                <h2>In The Beginning...</h2>
                <p>This was one of the more exciting project I got to work on. Our client was the Red Arena 501c3 nonprofit. The problem was that they had no real way to communicate with their employees and volunteers. They did have a system in place. The schedule was physically posted on a board. When ever there was a change they had to mass text all employees and volunteers to update them. If this was an organization of ten people, this wouldn’t be such a big deal. However, with around 100 staff members and volunteers it was clearly needed an update.</p>

                <p>The Research</p>
                <p>The first thing completed was a<span>SWOT Analysis</span>. For this I analyzed the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats for a sight such as this.</p>
                <p>After that we moved on to <span>User Personas</span> and <span>Word Lists.</span>. I use <span>Polarized Personas</span> when I do this so that by seeing many points of view I can design a product that meets the needs of many.</p>
                <p><span>User Stories</span> helped get an idea of process flow and what this site will actually need to do in order to meet the requirements set my the client.</p>

                <h2>The Design...</h2>
                <p>After the research was completed it was time to move on to the design portion of the project. AMy partner and I spent many hours in front of the white board discussing and editing our designs. We relied heavily on our research to guide out decisions. After we had sketched out our designs, we moved on to wireframing, style tiles and mockups. One of the requirements for this site was that we also create a styleguide.</p>

                    <p>The in the end I believe I turned out a visually appealing and practically useful project. That along with being visually appealing, any project has be practical. The challenges in the project were many. There is never enough time, but you have to make it work anyway. Keeping a steady schedule helped with time management and also keeping my eye on the <span>MVP</span> and not trying to add what wasn’t necessary. Using <span>Trello</span> was a big help in that endeavor. <a href="https://github.com/jhartley1412/Red_Arena" target="_blank">See it on Github.</a></p>
