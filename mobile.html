<h1>Mobile Design</h1>

<div class="mobile_wrapper">

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The goal of this excercise was to design a mobile app that would serve the needs of a Recreational Sports Team Captain. The captain needed to be able to receive updates from the League as well as updating Player Stats.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>My step in any new project is to find out exactly who my target audience is. In this case it was the Team Captain and Players. Since it this Rec League my target audience is a group of people looking to enjoythemselves a their weekly softball game. I looked at various sports apps to get a feel of what is available to the public. What I found was there isn't alot out there for this type of app. However, there are a great deal of score/stat keeping apps. I used these primarily to find a uniform layout for my stats page.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>There were many different directions to go with this app. After many hours of playing around with several colors I fealt a classic color pallete was in order. Enter one of my favorite baseball movies. The Band News Bears. A drawing off of a more seventies themed colors I fealt I was on the right direction.</p>

<p>Next I moved on to layout. Being as it was a mobile app I had to think primairly from a UX Standpoint. The app had to be as usable as possible while maintaining a friendly design. I decided that I did not want images destracting the user as they moved along the designed path. Instead I focused on more playfull icons as a means of directing my user. </p>
