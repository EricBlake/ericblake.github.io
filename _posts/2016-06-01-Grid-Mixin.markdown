When coding out a page it is easy to get caught up in a flow and forget structure of a page. “I can always go back and add that in” is not a good method. I was working on a site last night and reminded myself that I created a grid for a reason. The grid mix-in is a handy tool that helps my layout function when scaling from mobile to desktop. The main thing remember when starting to code, to pull back the reins a little bit and do your prep work. Take a look at my code pen example and tell me what you think.
