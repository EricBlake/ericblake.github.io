<div class="post_wrapper">
Today I dabbled in typography. I was interesting to see how I could change the mood of the text with the font. Looking and the different variations I could see a drastic difference. I am doing a restaurant webpage redesign and choosing the right one is a major decision. I think the key to learning typography is that you have to be willing to try many things before you can narrow your vision into a well designed product. A great deal of trial, error, editing and reevaluation are likely to be in the days ahead.
