<div class="post_wrapper">I’ve never been much of a sharer. I’m not sure that I have even posted facebook status in a few years. Here it goes. I left Houston (H-Town) to come to Austin and pursue a new career. I was lucky that I have a girlfriend and family who were very encouraging. I had a descent job. I can’t say that it was particularly enjoyable, but it was stable. A corporate-type gig. So what on earth possessed me to pack up, leave my family, city and dogs behind for twelve weeks while I embark on this new journey that may not pan out in the end? Who knows. Maybe some higher power or just a rash decision. Either way here I am and here I’ll stay until I come out on top.

Week one is about to come to a close and I must say that so far I have mixed reviews. I am in the UI Design class at The Iron Yard. I think this course is going to be twelve weeks of highs and lows. The first day I felt like I had jumped into the deep end of the pool and forgot my floaties. The instructors are all really nice and super helpful. You can tell that they really know their stuff. There is a strong feeling of being overwhelmed most of the time, but I’m told that is by design. I do see that there is a method to the madness. In a weeks time I am writing html & css ten times better that I was on the first day with weeks of preparation leading up to my attendance. So I’ve decided to drink the kool aid and dive in head first. Hopefully I can swim without the floaties. If you like you can track my progress with the below link.

-See you next week
