<h1>About Eric</h1>
<p>I am a UI Designer based in Austin, TX. I moved here from Houston to start a carreer as a Web Designer. I worked in the title industry for a number of years. I found that I wasn't being challenged to my full potential. After enrolling in The Iron Yard I began learning all the I could to design Clean, Usable and Appealling user interactions for users.<p>
