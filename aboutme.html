        <h2>Hi, I'm Eric</h2>
        <p>I studied history at Stephen F. Austin State University. I found that helped me appease my curious personality. I'm the type of guy that will spend all day in the library and be perfectly happy doing so. After college I entered the world of real estate where I was a title examiner for many years. I didn't feel like I was being challenged so I enrolled at THE IRON YARD to begin my carreer in design. I have a passion for responsive clean design.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for UI Design. I believe in designing clean layouts that promote both a memorable and beneficial User Experience for all those that see my webpages.</p>
        <p>There has never been a way to reach and connect with others quite like the web. We can design in a way that changes lives for the better.</p>
