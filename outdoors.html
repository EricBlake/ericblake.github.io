                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>This was my final project with The Iron Yard. The Idea came about some time ago. While planning a camping trip to Davy Crocket National Forest. Even though it was me and one other person, I found it difficult just getting started. Who was going to bring what? When were we going to be able go? Is that the only place between the two of us that we can go?</p>
                <p>	I had been thinking of a suitable topic for my final project when it came to me that I had wished for app that could do just that and with my new found skills, I could do it myself. So now the easy part was over and the real work began.</p>
