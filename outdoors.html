                <h2>In The Beginning...</h2>
                <p>This was my final project with The Iron Yard. The Idea came about some time ago. While planning a camping trip to Davy Crocket National Forest. Even though it was me and one other person, I found it difficult just getting started. Who was going to bring what? When were we going to be able go? Is that the only place between the two of us that we can go?</p>
                <p> I had been thinking of a suitable topic for my final project when it came to me that I had wished for app that could do just that and with my new found skills, I could do it myself. So now the easy part was over and the real work began.</p>

                <h2>The Research</h2>
                <p>I find that before putting code to computer the research phase is the most important and often times most overlooked portion part of the process. </p>
                <p>In my research I completed a <span>SWOT Analysis</span>. For this I analyzed the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats for a sight such as this.</p>
                <p>After That I moved on to My User Personas. I use <span>Polarized Personas</span> when I do this so that by seeing many points of view I can design a product that meets the needs of many.</p>
                <p><span>User Stories</span> help me get an idea of process flow and what my site will actually need to do in order to meet the requirements I set.</p>
