Last week I did a Web App Redesign for the Linked In Home Page. This was an interesting challenge. We worked of set style guides and had an option to choose two of five. I chose to use the US Web Design Style Guide and the style guide for Healthcare.gov. In hind site I wish I had chosen two style guides that were a little more different. I am still working on it, but if you want to take a look follow the link below.

I learned to use Jekyll a little bit more for this project. I had My sass separated into a few different files for this project. I separated out my main css, color styling, typography and each breakpoint for the page. I will probably continue to do this from now on, because it was very convenient. I don’t think the color and typography will be separated because after I was towards the end of the project I thought that those could have been combined with less of a headache.
<div></div>
I did enjoy doing an app. Mostly because it is a site where people can go and interact with your design vs. just looking at a page. Some of the things I know I need and will work on going forward. Spacing between headers and paragraphs, font size (mostly not going too large), and my button styling. Some of the things I did well on this week is Margins. Margins had been a pain to me until this week, but I made it a point to make very sure that all my margins were uniform (On Mobile at least, still working on the others). I received some good feed back from the company Clearhead and am looking forward to making some changes when I have a moment.
This weekend we are moving into the group project. I could not me more exhausted so Friday night will be reserved for nothing but sleep. Then we can all hit it hard on Saturday and hopefully turn out a good final product. I’ll let everyone knows how it turns out in my next post. Until then just keep on keepin on.
